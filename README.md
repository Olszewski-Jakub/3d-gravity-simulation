# Gravity Simulator

A 3D gravitational physics simulator for learning linear algebra and differential equations through celestial mechanics.

## Overview

This project provides an interactive way to explore the mathematics behind orbital mechanics and gravitational physics. By simulating celestial bodies in 3D space, users can gain intuition for abstract mathematical concepts like vector operations, linear algebra, and numerical integration techniques.

## Key Features

- **Interactive 3D visualization** of gravitational systems
- **Multiple integration methods** (Euler, Verlet, Runge-Kutta 4)
- **Real-time parameter adjustment** to explore different scenarios

## Getting Started

### Try It Online

Experience the simulator directly in your browser:

ðŸš€ [**Launch Gravity Simulator Web App**](https://3d-gravity-simulation.vercel.app)

### Local Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Olszewski-Jakub/3d-gravity-simulation.git
cd gravity-simulator
npm install
npm start
```

### Setup Configuration

1. **Basic Setup**: The default configuration simulates our solar system with realistic parameters.

2. **Custom Scenarios**:
    - Adjust integration method in settings panel

3. **Performance Tips**:
    - For complex simulations with many bodies, use the "Performance Mode"
    - Dedicated GPU recommended for simulations with >1000 particles
